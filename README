# NetworkDEVS
#### A Network simulation tool for data network educational purposes

All the instructions of this README file works in Linux Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

## Dependencies
1. PowerDEVS
2. C++11 >

**Note:** To compile the model in PowerDEVS IDE the flag *-std=c++11* must be added to the *CXXFLAGS* variable of the PowerDEVS makefile in *powerdevs/engine/Makefile.include*. 
Also, in order to debug using the GDB option of PowerDEVS IDE, this flag must also be added in the same way to *powerdevs/engine/Makefile.include.debug*.

## PowerDEVS issues
It's posible that PowerDEVS does not compile after its instalation, if that is the case, the next steps should solve the problem. 
If this does not solves the problem contact the PowerDEVS team or join the PowerDEVS forum for help https://sourceforge.net/p/powerdevs/discussion/general/

1. Finde the file powerdevs/engine/Makefile.include
2. Add -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial/ at the end of the of the includes line: INCLUDES = -I$(SRCENGINE) -I$(ATOMICS) -I$(BUILD) -L$(BUILDLIB) -I/usr/include/hdf5/serial/

**Note:** If hdf5 is placed in other path, then the correct path sould be set

## How to compile and run the scenario of the case study
In order to get the case stady that comes in this project working, the next steps are the instructions: 

1. The root directory of this project must be copied into powerdevs/atomics/ with the name PowerDEVS
2. The open the file powerdevs/atomics/PowerDEVS/scenario/top.pdm in PowerDEVS
3. Compile
4. Run simulation

* The simulation output is in the scenario/output folder
* The simulation input is in the scenario/input folder
* The logger output will be in powerdevs/output/pdevs.log

## How to compile and run the unit tests
In order to compile the unit test, the same steps as the scenario should be made.
All the tests files are in the folder test/<case>.pdm and only must be opened with PowerDEVS, compiled and ran

## Documentation
This projects comes with HTML Doxygen documentation, to open the main page just open NetworkDEVS/doxygen/html/index.html in a web browser.
