\subsection*{A Network simulation framework for D\+E\+VS and Power\+D\+E\+VS}

{\bfseries Note\+:} To compile the model in Power\+D\+E\+VS I\+DE the flag $\ast$-\/std=c++11$\ast$ must be added to the {\itshape C\+X\+X\+F\+L\+A\+GS} variable of the Power\+D\+E\+VS makefile in {\itshape powerdevs/engine/\+Makefile.\+include}. Also, in order to debug using the G\+DB option of Poewr\+D\+E\+VS I\+DE, this flag must also be added in the same way to {\itshape powerdevs/engine/\+Makefile.\+include.\+debug}.
